# ADoSnipsDLF24

This is a skill for the SnipsHermesQnD framework for Snips.ai
to read news from the DLF24 news-feed.

# Installation

Add the framework app and ADoSnips24 to your Snips assistant.   
The skill uses `xmlstarlet` to parse the DLF24 RSS-feed. Be sure
to install it on the device running the skill
(`sudo apt-get install xmlstarlet`).

# Julia

This skill is (like the entire SnipsHermesQnD framework) written in the
modern programming language Julia (because Julia is faster
then Python and coding is much much easier and much more straight forward).
However "Pythonians" often need some time to get familiar with Julia.
